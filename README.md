## Description

I initially wanted a lightweight library that I could use in order to combine
another project of mine (called wlog). I need and want something that I can
log my work on local tasks, and then push them to redmine (kind of like 
distributed version control). 

If you can find a use for this with your project as well, then ... EXCELLENT.

## Features

A very simple way of querying your redmine stuff programmatically for any given
reason.

## Examples

    require 'psymine'

## Requirements

* Ruby 2.0 (probably works with earlier versions too, give me a shout 
confirming if so).

## Install

    $ gem install psymine
